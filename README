Wizardly Chess:

###
## Simple concept: 
## 
A chess board with a xy plotter underneath, attached to the plotter is an electromagnet. Add some polish and should have a magical chess set.

###
## Parts (What I'm using in the current iteration)
## 
Arduino Mega - Microcontroller, might swap to a NodeMCU once I get things working.
